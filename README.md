# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-ML
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the characteristics of cell nuclei present in a breast cancer dataset. Using a logistic regression model, we aim to predict the type of cancer from the provided features and assess the accuracy of our predictions.
