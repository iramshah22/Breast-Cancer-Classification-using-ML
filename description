Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on the characteristics of cell nuclei present in a breast cancer dataset. Using a logistic regression model, we aim to predict the type of cancer from the provided features and assess the accuracy of our predictions.
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, available in the sklearn library. It contains 569 instances and 30 features, which describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Data Collection: The dataset is loaded using the sklearn.datasets module.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure unbiased evaluation of the model’s performance.
Modeling: Logistic Regression is applied to the training data to build the classification model.
Evaluation: The model’s accuracy is assessed using the test data, and metrics such as accuracy score are calculated to measure its performance.

Results:
The accuracy of the logistic regression model on this dataset is evaluated to ensure its reliability in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors.

Technologies Used:
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

How to Run the Code:
Clone the repository.
Install the necessary libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for binary classification, specifically in identifying breast cancer malignancy. Further enhancements can include testing different models or tuning hyperparameters to improve the performance.
